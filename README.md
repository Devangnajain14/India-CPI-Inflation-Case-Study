# India-CPI-Inflation-Case-Study(EDA|Advance Excel)
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is one of the most widely used indicators to measure inflation in India. It represents a fixed basket of goods and services consumed by the average Indian household. This basket includes essentials such as food, beverages, clothing, housing, fuel, transportation, medical care, education, and recreation.

CPI is calculated by comparing the price level of this basket during a given time period with that of a base year. Tracking CPI helps policymakers, economists, and businesses understand inflationary trends, assess purchasing power, and plan economic strategies.

In this case study, we analyze Indiaâ€™s CPI Inflation Data using Advanced Excel techniques to generate insights into inflation behavior across multiple categories.
